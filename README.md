## dbverse
The `dbverse` is an ecosystem of open-source and composable database libraries for larger-than-memory scientific data analysis. The `dbverse` provides object relational mappings for common scientific data objects, including sparse and dense matrices, spatial data frames, genomic files, and others, and is powered by `DuckDB`.
